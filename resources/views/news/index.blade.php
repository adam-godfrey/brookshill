		              	<p>Our orchard is in !!! we are super ecstatic to have started our very own agroforestry scheme which involves combining agriculture and trees.</p>
                        <p>Agroforestry is a land management approach with multiple benefits. Planting trees on farms optimises the soil condition by releasing carbon into the soil and preventing erosion by wind and rain. Of course, there is importantly a huge benefit to wildlife which we love. We have planted an orchard in avenues of apple, pear, plum and cherry so lots of foraging as well as shelter for our resident wildlife.</p>
                        <p>We have created a silvo-pastoral agroforestry scheme which means that we will be grazing animals under our trees once they are mature enough. The animals enrich the soil while the trees provide shelter and fodder for the animals. The trees even help reduce the need for pesticides by housing natural predators. A huge bonus is that in the spring and early summer when the orchards are in blossom it will look pretty spectacular, especially if you happen to be in our shepherd's hut.</p>
